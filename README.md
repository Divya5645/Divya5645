              <h3>Hey! Did you ever thought how some people are able to tell about the future</h3>
              <p>
                A prediction or forecast is about a future event or data.They are often,but not always based on past knowledge and experience.Future events are necessarily uncertain,so guarenteed accurate information about the future is impossible.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> You‚Äôll gain valuable insight <br>Forecasting gets you into the habit of looking at past and real-time data to predict future demand. And in doing so, you‚Äôll be able to anticipate demand fluctuations more effectively. But more than that, it‚Äôll give you insight into your company‚Äôs health and provide you with an opportunity to course-correct or make adjustments.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>You‚Äôll learn from past mistakes<br>You don‚Äôt start from scratch after each forecast. Even if your prediction was nowhere close to what ended up coming to pass, it gives you a starting point. It‚Äôs common to review where and why things didn‚Äôt happen the way you predicted. Your forecasts should eventually improve. But more than that, you‚Äôll get into the habit of reflecting upon past performance as a whole. And self-reflection can be a powerful driver of company growth</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>It can decrease costs<br> When done right, anticipating demand will help you tweak your processes to increase efficiency all along the supply chain. Because you‚Äôre better able to predict what customers will want and when they‚Äôll want it, you may also be able to decrease excess inventory levels, thus increasing overall profitability.

                      The Soothsayers are rather mystical beings who predict the future based on personal, political, spiritual, mental and/or religious beliefs and will include relevent scientific facts. They speak from ancient knowledge. Soothsayers can, and do, include many Astrologers, Augurs, Clairvoyants, Practitioners of divination, Fortune tellers, Haruspices, Oracles, Prophets, Seers, Shamans, Hannigans, Warlocks, Witches and Psychic Readers.</h4>

                    <h3 class="mb-3">Many English Drama Acts Also Includes The Act Of Foresee</h3>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">In the play Julius Caesar, by William Shakespeare, a warning from a Soothsayer serves as a deterrent for the protagonist, Julius Caesar. The Soothsayer‚Äôs prophetic warning is heavy with irony because Caesar will be killed of the Ides of March. Caesar, who studies the man and his words, exercises poor judgement in dismissing both.a Soothsayer calls out from the crowd to Julius Caesar, warning him to ‚ÄúBeware of the Ides of March!‚Äù asks the Soothsayer to come forward and repeat the warning again and decides, ‚ÄúHe is a dreamer, let us leave him‚Äù. Caesar‚Äôs extreme vanity leads him to believe that he is absolutely secure from attack by mere humans. Brutus repeats the fortuneteller‚Äôs warning, but Caesar ignores him as well. The Soothsayer‚Äôs warning to Caesar is one of the first of many ironies that pervade the play. His firm belief that he is immune to any personal danger will cause him to participate in his own slaughter by ignoring the Soothsayer. Caesar, being a great war general and conqueror of nations, sees himself as invincible on many levels. It could be said that the Soothsayer‚Äôs warning is seen as a challenge to Caesar‚Äôs invincibility. Thereby setting himself up for his own death. In the end, Caesar is the dreamer and does not see the reality that his views and ambitions are a threat to many. Caesar‚Äôs delusion is that he can defeat the fate of the gods. However, it is he who dies and bleeds as any man. Obviously, the Soothsayer is a deterrent to Julius Caesar for the simple reason that what he said was true</h4>
